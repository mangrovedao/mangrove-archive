/* # Dex Summary
   * Each Dex instance is half an offerbook for two ERC20 tokens.
   * Each offer promises `base` and requests `quote`.
   * Each offer has an attached `maker` address.
   * When an offer is executed, we:
     1. Flashloan some `quote` to the offer's `maker`.
     2. Call an arbitrary `execute` function on that address.
     3. Transfer back some `base`.
   * Offer are just promises. They can fail.
   * If an offer fails to transfer the right amount back, the loan is reverted.
   * A penalty mechanism incentivizes keepers to keep the book clean of failing offers.
   * A penalty provision must be posted with each offer.
   * If the offer succeeds, the provision returns to the maker.
   * If the offer fails, the provision is given to the taker as penalty.
   * The penalty should overcompensate for the taker's lost gas.

         If an offer fails, `gasprice` wei is taken from the
         provision per unit of gas used. `gasprice` should approximate the average gas
         price at offer creation time.

         `gasbase` is _24 bits wide_ -- note that if more room was needed, we could bring it down to 8 bits and have it represent 1k gas increments.

         `gasbase` is also the name of global Dex
         parameters. When an offer is created, its current value is added to
         the offer's `OfferDetail`. The maker does not choose it.

   So, when an offer is created, the maker is asked to provision the
   following amount of wei:
   ```
   (gasreq + gasbase) * gasprice
   ```
    When an offer fails, the following amount is given to the taker as compensation:
   ```
   (gasused + gasbase) * gasprice

/* # Example */
/* `preproc.structs_with_macros` generates preprocessor instruction to get/set all fields in the above structs. A preprocessor method `m(args)` is invoked in solidity code by writing `$$(m(args))`.

For instance, the structs object

```
{
  myStruct: [
    {name: "a", bits: 8,  type: "uint"},
    {name: "b", bits: 160, type: "address"}
  ]
}
```

will generate the following preprocessor macros:
* `set_myStruct(ptr,values)`. In a context where the solidity variable `v` holds an encoded `myStruct`, it can be used with `$$(set_myStruct('v',[['b','msg.sender']]))`. Note that solidity expression are given as strings. Here : `$$(set_myStruct('v',[['a',256]]))` and in all other methods, arguments exceeding the `bits` parameter of a field will be left-truncated.
* `make_myStruct(values)`. An optimised version of `set_myStruct` where the initial value is the null word.
* `myStruct_a(ptr)`, to access the `a` field. Returns a uint. If the solidity variable `v` holds an encoded `myStruct`, it can be used with `$$(myStruct_a('v'))`.
* `myStruct_b(ptr)`, to access the `b` field. Returns an address.
