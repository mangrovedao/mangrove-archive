A simple configurable gas price update bot for the Mangrove DEX.

The bot either employs a (configurable) constant gas price, or queries an external oracle for gas prices. It sends gas price updates to Mangrove, through Mangroves dedicated oracle contract.

# Installation

First, clone the repo and install the prerequisites for the monorepo described in the root [README.md](../../README.md).

Next, run the following commands:

```shell
$ cd <Mangrove monorepo>/packages/updategas-bot
$ yarn install   # Sets up the Mangrove monorepo and install dependencies
$ yarn build     # Builds the gas update bot and its dependencies
```

# Usage

The JSON-RPC endpoint and private key that the bot should use must be specified in the following environment variables:

```yaml
# The URL for an Ethereum-compatible JSON-RPC endpoint
ETHEREUM_NODE_URL=<URL>
# example:
ETHEREUM_NODE_URL=https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/abcd-12345679

# The private key for transaction signing
PRIVATE_KEY=<private key>
# example:
PRIVATE_KEY=0x7c852118294e51e653712a81e05800f419141751be58f605c371e15141b007a6
```

These can either be set in the environment or in a `.env*` file. The bot uses [dotenv-flow](https://github.com/kerimdzhanov/dotenv-flow) for reading `.env*` files and [.env.local.example](.env.local.example) is an example of such a file.

To start the bot, simply run

```shell
$ yarn start
```

## Configuration

The bot has a number of configurable settings (which are currently read and used at startup, so need a redeploy to change configuration (_subject to change_)).

Here's an example configuration file with instances of all possible configuration values:

```json
{
  "log": {
    "logLevel": "info"
  },
  "acceptableGasGapToOracle": 0.5,
  "constantOracleGasPrice": 3,
  "oracleURL": "https://gasstation-mainnet.matic.network/",
  "oracleURL_Key": "standard",
  "runEveryXHours": 8
}
```

- `log-level`: Sets the logging level - the bot employs the [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logger, and it's default log-levels.
- `acceptableGasGapToOracle`: If the difference between Mangrove's current gas price and the standard gas price reported by the oracle is above this threshold a gas price update will be sent to Mangrove's gas price oracle.
- `constantOracleGasPrice`: A constant gas price to be returned by this bot. _This setting overrides a given `oracleURL`._
- `oracleURL`: URL for an external oracle - expects a JSON REST endpoint a la <https://gasstation-mainnet.matic.network/>. _This setting is only used if `constantOracleGasPrice` is not given._
- `oracleURL_Key`: Name of key to lookup in JSON returned by JSON REST endpoint at `oracleURL`.
- `runEveryXHours`: Schedule bot to run with an interval of this many hours.

# Logging

The bot logs to `console.log` using [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston). More transports can be added by editing [src/util/logger.ts](src/util/logger.ts); Please refer to the Winston documentation for details.
