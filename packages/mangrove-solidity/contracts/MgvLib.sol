  A few words about why we include a `prev` field, and why we don't include a
  `next` field: in theory clients should need neither `prev` nor a `next` field.
  They could just 1. Read the order book state at a given block `b`.  2. On
  every event, update a local copy of the orderbook.  But in practice, we do not
  want to force clients to keep a copy of the *entire* orderbook. There may be a
  long tail of spam. Now if they only start with the first $N$ offers and
  receive a new offer that goes to the end of the book, they cannot tell if
  there are missing offers between the new offer and the end of the local copy
  of the book.
  
  So we add a prev pointer so clients with only a prefix of the book can receive
  out-of-prefix offers and know what to do with them. The `next` pointer is an
  optimization useful in Solidity (we traverse fewer memory locations) but
  useless in client code.
